 # Why I Made This

While listening to audiobooks, I found myself getting drowsy. Since I'd been researching spatial audio recently, I created a spatial audio-like effect. Because it uses a human ear model, it's best experienced with headphones.

Then while listening to YouTube ASMR, I discovered that adding this made it even more immersive and tingly. For certain unusual videos, the effect is probably quite remarkable...

# How It Works
1. Use BlackHole/BCABLE to capture system audio output, then synthesize spatial audio through HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function), and finally send it to the speakers
